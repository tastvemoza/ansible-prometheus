## Baba Movie Review: What Critics and Audiences Say
  
Baba movie received mixed reviews from critics and audiences when it was released in 2002. Some praised Rajinikanth's performance, A.R.Rahman's music and the spiritual theme of the movie, while others criticized the screenplay, direction and the political undertones of the movie. The Times of India gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, "Baba works strictly as an old-school masala movie starring the Superstar; something that recent Rajini films like Annaatthe, Darbar and Lingaa, could not manage to do."

However, the movie was a commercial failure at the box office and Rajinikanth had to reimburse the distributors for their losses. The movie was also embroiled in controversies due to its perceived political message and Rajinikanth's alleged support for a particular party. The movie was also banned in Karnataka due to a dialogue that offended some Kannada activists.
  
Despite the negative response, Baba movie gained a cult following over the years among Rajinikanth fans and admirers of spiritual cinema. The movie was also appreciated for its technical aspects, such as cinematography, editing and sound design. The movie was digitally remastered, re-edited with a shorter duration and an alternate ending, and re-released by Lyca Productions on 10 December 2022, twenty years after its original release, coinciding with Rajinikanth's birthday weekend. The re-released movie was declared a commercial success in the box office and received positive reviews from critics and audiences. [^2^]
