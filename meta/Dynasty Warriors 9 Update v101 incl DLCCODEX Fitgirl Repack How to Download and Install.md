If you are looking for some tips and tricks to make your gameplay more enjoyable and efficient, you might want to check out these suggestions:

- Don't play on normal difficulty. Normal difficulty is too easy and boring, as you will face fewer enemies and less challenge. Switch to hard or chaos difficulty to increase the number of enemy officers and grunts, and make the battles more intense and satisfying.
- Fast travel when you can. The open world map of Dynasty Warriors 9 is huge, and traveling by horse can take a long time. You can fast travel to any location you have discovered, as long as it is not under enemy control. This will save you a lot of time and hassle.
- Be mindful of nearby obstacles when fighting. Sometimes, you might accidentally knock enemy officers into walls, trees, buildings, or even out of bounds. This can make it harder for you to reach them and finish them off. Try to avoid using attacks that launch enemies into the air or push them back, and aim for open spaces when possible.
- Shopkeeper and blacksmith wares scale with the story. As you progress through the story mode, you will unlock more items and weapons to buy from shopkeepers and blacksmiths. You don't need to search for rare items or materials, as they will become available eventually. Just check the shops regularly and buy what you need.
- Always check traders. Traders are special NPCs that sell unique items that can be very useful or valuable. They have different inventories that change every day, so you never know what you might find. Some of the items they sell include gems, scrolls, elixirs, coins, and more.

Dynasty Warriors 9 Update v1.01 incl DLC-CODEX Fitgirl Repack is a game that offers a lot of content and options for players who love hack and slash action. With these tips and tricks, you can make your gameplay more fun and rewarding. Download and install it now and unleash your inner warrior!
